Pros:
Agile teams can quickly adjust to changes in requirements or priorities.

The iterative approach allows for the delivery of working software in small, frequent increments, getting products to market faster.

Cons:
Implementing and scaling Agile in large organizations can be difficult.
The flexibility that allows for changes can lead to an undefined or expanding scope if not managed carefully.
